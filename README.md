# Transformer Model in Deep Learning

Welcome to the Transformer Model repository! This project focuses on implementing a Transformer model, a powerful architecture in deep learning, known for its success in various natural language processing (NLP) and sequence-to-sequence tasks. Whether you're a deep learning enthusiast, researcher, or someone interested in transformers, this code provides insights into building and understanding the Transformer architecture.

## Features

- **Transformer Architecture:** Implement the core Transformer model, as introduced in the "Attention is All You Need" paper by Vaswani et al.

- **Attention Mechanism:** Explore the self-attention mechanism, a key component of the Transformer, enabling the model to weigh input elements differently based on their relevance.

- **Positional Encoding:** Integrate positional encoding to provide information about the position of tokens in the input sequence, overcoming the lack of sequential information in the original Transformer architecture.

- **Multi-Head Attention:** Implement multi-head attention to capture different aspects of the input sequence simultaneously, enhancing the model's ability to learn complex patterns.

- **Position-wise Feedforward Networks:** Incorporate position-wise feedforward networks to further process information captured by the attention mechanism.
